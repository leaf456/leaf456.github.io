			<h1>Hi, I'm leaf456!</h1>
			<h3>I'm a programmer that lives in Australia. <br>I enjoy programming in javascript, python and (sometimes) lua! I mainly code in javascript because it's extremely easy to use, although I will happily try new languages.<br>If you want to contact me, you can look in my social links or join my discord server at <a href="https://discord.gg/7eQa4bmB2g">https://discord.gg/7eQa4bmB2g</a></h3>

			<h3 id="wordalle">Wordalle remade</h3>
			<img src="images/wordalle.png" style="width: 60%;"></img>
			<p>About a year ago I found out about <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/huggingface-projects/wordalle">wordalle</a> and thought it was a really neat idea. Now, a year later, and it hasn't been updated for several months so I decided to remake it with new prompts. I asked chatgpt for ideas of prompts and used DALL-E 2 to create the images. The project mostly uses javascript with a small hint of html and css mixed in. Since I don't want to have the same thing that happened to the original wordalle happen to mine, I'll try to add new images regularily, although I can't guarantee anything.</p>

			<h3 id="diep.io">Bad diep.io copy</h3>
			<img src="images/baddiep.png" style="width: 60%;"></img>
			<p>A copy of the popular game diep.io. My coding on this project is really good because I grouped variables and stuff into objects for variables so it was really clean and easy to understand. This is probably one of my projects that I'm more proud of just because of how cleanly it turned out - all static files and very similar physics to the real game.</p>

			<h3 id="gettingoverit">Getting over it scratch edition in an extension</h3>
			<img src="images/gettingoverit.png" style="width: 60%;"></img>
			<p>A bit of time ago I played this game called "getting over it in scratch" and it was really fun. I put it in an extension and uploaded it to the chrome web store and it got to something like 2000 downloads. Obviously I wasn't making any money from it or anything but it was still really cool knowing that at least 2000 people were using something that I made. Of course, google had to be google and they removed it from the chrome web store, claiming that it had an "inaccurate description". </p>

			<h3 id="2dvoxel">2d voxel region separator</h3>
			<img src="images/2dregionseperator.png" style="width: 60%;"></img>
			<p>A bit of a test project to see what the limits for this sort of thing is on the cpu. It works pretty well even when testing for closed loops every time a block is placed, although I'm sure it could be optimised alot. I'm pretty sure I intended to use this for some sort of cool project but I think I just got bored of it or forgot about it.</p>

			<h3 id="sorting">Sorting</h3>
			<img src="images/sorting.png" style="width: 60%;"></img>
			<p>A while ago I was interested in sorting algorithms so I made this little program that shows a sorting algorithm in real time. It's written in lua and uses the LÖVE framework to render the window and algorithm.</p>

			<h3 id="autocomplete">Google autocomplete API demo</h3>
			<img src="images/googleautocomplete.png" style="width: 60%;"></img>
			<p>When I was looking around google chromes network requests I saw the autocomplete api and decided to create this project. Obviously the code is public so feel free to use this in your own projects. Just know that google blocks cross-domain requests so you will need a CORS proxy if you use this on a website.</p>

			<h3 id="transfer">LÖVE2d code transfer</h3>
			<img src="images/transfer.png" style="width: 60%;"></img>
			<p>Same as sorting, I was interested in working with mobile devices while using the LÖVE framework, and didn't like the hastle of moving files to the device every time I needed to test the code, so I made LÖVE2d code transfer. It also uses a bit of python for the server but it probably isn't the best. It's kinda funny because the client screen kinda looks like a keypad so it's like you're entering a password, however you're only entering your local network address for your server.</p>
