			<h1>Hi, I'm leaf456!</h1>
			<h3>I'm a programmer that lives in Australia. <br>I mostly program in javascript, python and lua. I mainly code in javascript because it's the most used language in the world, although I try new languages sometimes.<br>If you want to contact me, you can look in my social links or add me on discord at @idk_3341</h3>
			<h2>Why am I leaf456?</h1>
			<h3>I dunno, Github just made it for me when I made my account.</h3>
			<h2>What I'm currently working on</h1>
			<h3>Right now I'm focused on more low-level things like x86 assembly and memory management. I find it intresting how such basic instructions can make machines like modern computers work so fast and effeciently.</h3>

			<h3 id="games">Portable games</h3>
			<img src="images/games.png" style="width: 60%;"></img>
			<p>So one day I wondered if it was possible to port a game into a single .html file that could be run directly from a users filesystem. I made a little script that polyfilled the `fetch` and `xmlhttprequest` api with a pre-made base64-encoded response and tested it with some projects I already had, and suprisingly it worked. I then ported a few games before making the website and put it all on my two domains <a href="https://games.ohioskibidisigma.com">games.ohioskibidisigma.com</a> and <a href="https://portablegam.es">portablegam.es</a>. Over time I've added more then 20 games to the website (all playable locally too!) and I keep adding them (as of 15/10/2024, that is). Usually the sites have some sort of copy-protection in place so it's certainly been an experience to get past those protections so easily.</p>

			<img src="images/wordalle.png" style="width: 60%;"></img>
			<p>About a year ago I found out about <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/huggingface-projects/wordalle">wordalle</a> and thought it was a really neat idea. Now, a year later, and it hasn't been updated for several months so I decided to remake it with new prompts. I asked chatgpt for ideas of prompts and used DALL-E 2 to create the images. The project mostly uses javascript with a small hint of html and css mixed in.</p>

			<h3 id="diep.io">Bad diep.io copy</h3>
			<img src="images/baddiep.png" style="width: 60%;"></img>
			<p>A copy of the popular game diep.io. This is my first project where I used OOP so I was still getting used to it. This is probably one of my projects that I'm more proud of just because of how cleanly it turned out - all static files and very similar physics to the real game.</p>

			<h3 id="gettingoverit">Getting over it scratch edition in an extension</h3>
			<img src="images/gettingoverit.png" style="width: 60%;"></img>
			<p>A bit of time ago I played this game called "getting over it in scratch" and it was really fun. I put it in an extension and uploaded it to the chrome web store and it got to something like 2000 downloads. Obviously I wasn't making any money from it or anything but it was still really cool knowing that at least 2000 people were using something that I made. Of course, google had to be google and they removed it from the chrome web store, claiming that it had an "inaccurate description". </p>

			<h3 id="2dvoxel">2d voxel region separator</h3>
			<img src="images/2dregionseperator.png" style="width: 60%;"></img>
			<p>A bit of a test project to see what the limits for this sort of thing is on the cpu. It works pretty well even when testing for closed loops every time a block is placed, although I'm sure it could be optimised alot.</p>

			<h3 id="sorting">Sorting</h3>
			<img src="images/sorting.png" style="width: 60%;"></img>
			<p>A while ago I was interested in sorting algorithms so I made this little program that shows a sorting algorithm in real time. It's written in lua and uses the LÖVE framework to render the window and algorithm.</p>

			<h3 id="autocomplete">Google autocomplete API demo</h3>
			<img src="images/googleautocomplete.png" style="width: 60%;"></img>
			<p>When I was looking around google chromes network requests I saw the autocomplete api and decided to create this project. Obviously the code is public so feel free to use this in your own projects. Just know that google blocks cross-domain requests so you will need a CORS proxy if you use this on a website.</p>

			<h3 id="transfer">LÖVE2d code transfer</h3>
			<img src="images/transfer.png" style="width: 60%;"></img>
			<p>Same as sorting, I was interested in working with mobile devices while using the LÖVE framework, and didn't like the hastle of moving files to the device every time I needed to test the code, so I made LÖVE2d code transfer. It also uses a bit of python for the server but it probably isn't the best. It's kinda funny because the client screen kinda looks like a keypad so it's like you're entering a password, however you're only entering your local network address for your server.</p>
